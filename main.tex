\begin{abstract}

\noindent During the collapse of large impact craters, an extraordinary degree of rock weakening occurs. Current models fail to predict localised weakening, thus only broad-scale crater characteristics are reproduced. Acoustic fluidisation is a physical mechanism that describes localised weakening via the action of acoustic vibrations. In this work, the iSALE impact cratering hydrocode is successfully modified to include the full Melosh model of acoustic fluidisation. A comparison between the Melosh model and a widely used alternative, the block model, was carried out. The two models were found to be most similar for generation of simple craters; however, complex crater collapse in the block model is facilitated  by a deep weakening, whereas shallow weakening results in crater collapse for the Melosh model. The Melosh model of acoustic fluidisation is shown to be an effective model of dynamic weakening, differing from the block model by its style of crater collapse and peak ring formation.
